This App has 3 phases
     1. Local, non-persisted list of books.
     2. List of books persisted with outside API.
     3. Outside API + centralized state.

Things we need to do.
1. create the API and understand how it works
2. When app startsup, make a request to API to get the current list of books
3. When user creates/edits/deletes a book, update the API, then update local data

JSON server setup
1. Install JSON-Server with NPM at the terminal.
2. Create a 'db.json' file. This is where data will be stored.
3. Create a command to run JSON-Server.
4. Run the Command.

Standalone API Client
1. Program used to make requests to an API server, specifically for development/test
2. There are many free API clients
3. I am going to use one built into VSCode.
